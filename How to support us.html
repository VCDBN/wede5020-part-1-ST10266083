<p> Give Power to SA will be funded by overseas investors that want to grow their 
    business name by providing solar panels to previously disadvantaged South Africans to create a good business image in the public relations for them. 
    Give Power to SA also going to host charities to be able to provide previously disadvantaged South Africans with the right resources. 
    We will also invest some of our own money to help. We will go to the areas and investigate and see if it is safe to do so, 
    then we will need to educate South Africans on how to use Solar panels correctly. We will appreciate donations from all. </p>
